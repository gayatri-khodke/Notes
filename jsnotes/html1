object-fit property 
The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an <img> or <video> should be resized to fit its container.

The object-fit property in CSS is used to specify how an image or video should fit into its container. Think of it like telling the image or video how to behave if it doesnâ€™t perfectly match the container's size. Here are its main values explained simply:

fill: The image or video will stretch to fill the entire container, even if it means changing its aspect ratio (could look squished or stretched).

contain: The image or video will resize to fit inside the container, keeping its aspect ratio (no squishing). There might be empty space around it if the container and the image/video have different shapes.

cover: The image or video will resize to cover the entire container, keeping its aspect ratio. Some parts might get cropped off if the container and the image/video have different shapes.

none: The image or video will not be resized at all. It will be displayed in its original size, which might overflow the container.

scale-down: The image or video will either be displayed at its original size or scaled down to fit the container, whichever makes it smaller.
