1) what is programming language?

* it is set of instruction ot code which tell our computer what it need to do. 
* can work stand alone. means it don't need any support of any other language. 
* every programming language can not be scripting language.
* programming language can compile or inteprate 
* java 
* c , c++ need to compiled before running.

* programming languae can work stand alone. 

* ex :- c, c++, python js, java.
jvm:-jvm java virtual machine. 
jdk :-java development kit.


2) what is scripting language?
* every scripting language is basically programming language.
* scripting language does not include the compilation step. basically it is intepreted.
* it does not need of compilation. ex python , javascript.
(inteprete it will check our code line by line if any error occure then the it will throw error and it will not execute further code.)
js or php dont need to compiled.
* in most cases it work as a stand alone as well as it work combine with other langaue.

* ex python , javascript , php, pul, rubi,


3) what is markup language?
is is completely different from programming language and scripting language. it prepare the structure data or prepare the look or design of the page.
* it is also stand alone language. 
* it is prasentational language. it prasent our web page on browser. can not manipulate the thing.  if we want to manipulate then we need to used scription languae.
* ex html ,css Xml



*** generally compiled programs run faster thean interpreted program. because they first converted native machine code. also compilers read and analyze the code only once, report the error. 

where as interpreter will read and analyze the code statements each time. 

4) different between compiler and transpiler?
* transpiler:- converts source code from one programming language to another programming language.
ex babel transpile the jsx into javascript that browser can understand.


* compiler:- translates source code into machine code.  ex high level programming language to low level programming. 


5)  what is procedural programming language?
* procedural programming uses a very detailed list of instructions to tell the computer what to do step by step. This approach can repeat the series of steps as often as needed.


6)  what is funciton programming language?
function programming is an approach to problem solving that treats every 


python is a multi-paradigm programming language.
it support ot oop , programming language, structured programming languae.


7) what is garbage collection?


type of inheritance in python?
